# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-and-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Machine Learning project on Airbnb price prediction and customer churn analysis using regression and classification models.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on two real-world business problems:

1️⃣ Predicting Airbnb listing prices using regression models.
2️⃣ Predicting customer churn using classification models.

The goal was to apply machine learning techniques to generate actionable insights for pricing optimization and customer retention.
